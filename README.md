# Marketing-Mix-Modeling-MMM-ROI-Budget-Optimization
Executive Summary This project identifies the efficiency of marketing spend across various channels for DT Mart. By leveraging Regression Analysis and Time-Series transformations, I isolated the "Revenue Lift" generated by TV and Digital advertising from organic baseline sales.The resulting dashboard provides a Decision Support framework to reallocate underperforming budgets to high-ROI channels.

Business Problem
A brand is spending millions across fragmented media channels (TV, Digital, Radio, SEM) but cannot quantify which channel is the primary driver of the 3bn GMV. Without a mathematical attribution model, the company risks overspending on "saturated" channels while missing growth opportunities.

Technical Methodology
Data Modeling (Star Schema): Re-engineered a "spider-web" data model into a optimized Star Schema, utilizing a central Calendar table to align media spend with sales events.

Adstock Transformation: Implemented a decay-rate logic (75% retention) to account for the "carryover" effect of advertising over time.

Diminishing Returns: Modeled saturation points to identify when additional spend on a specific channel stops yielding proportional revenue.

DAX Engineering: Developed custom measures for Estimated GMV Lift and Channel ROAS to benchmark performance against a 1.0 break-even threshold.

Key Insights & Recommendations
Channel Efficiency: Digital advertising achieved a significantly higher ROAS (320) compared to TV (350), despite TV occupying a larger portion of the initial budget distribution.

Seasonality Impact: Cross-referencing the SpecialSale table revealed that marketing efficiency spiked during October 2015, while organic baseline sales remained steady.

Proposed Budget Shift: Based on marginal ROI analysis, a 10% reallocation from TV spend to Digital channels is projected to increase total GMV by 4%.

Dashboard Features
Interactive Slicers: Allows stakeholders to filter by Sale Event and Month to see real-time ROI shifts.

Performance Audit Log: A detailed monthly table with conditional formatting to flag underperforming months.

Budget Distribution: A donut chart visualizer showing current vs. recommended share of voice.
